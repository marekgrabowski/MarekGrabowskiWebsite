As a final project for my mobile app development class I alongside 2 classmates developed an andriod app written in kotlin to help solve a common problem. Having free time to sit down to watch a Tv show or movie, but having no clue on what to watch. In this app you are able to select the streaming services you have, and then serach for any film, actor, director, and see what platform its located on, alongside the top films of those actors/directors.

## My Current Contributions

I took inititive by designing an initital web server/interface written on python and written in flask. This includes a home screen as well as dynamically generated pages for whatever stock a user chooses. These dynamically generated pages will have a table with the historical stock data from yahoo finance alongside top news headlines and our analysis on the future movement, as well as an opinion the the sentiment of professionals and the public towards that specific stock and company. 

## Planned Contributions

I plan on implementing user acounts through firebase where users can add stocks to a watch list, and potentially put in their currrent positions in order to be notified when major developments occur in the market or that specific stock in order to prompt the user to increase/decrease their positon. 

In addition to the front-end I plan on assisting on the backend on data collectiona and manipulation as well as the AI applying recently learned skills from the AI class I took this past Spring.
