As a final project for my mobile app development class I alongside 2 classmates developed an android app written in kotlin to help solve a common problem. Having free time to sit down to watch a Tv show or movie, but having no clue on what to watch. In this app you are able to select the streaming services you have, and then serach for any film, actor, director, and see what platform its located on, alongside the top films of those actors/directors.

## My Contributions

My primary contributions had to do with implementing the ThemMoviesDB API and queries into it cross referencing with IMDB for actor information, parsing and feeding data into our database and helping assist in the display of this information.
